  <p><font size="6">About me</font></p>
  <p> I'm currently pursuing a B.S in Computer Science as a sophmore in
    the University at Buffalo. I transferred to this insitution during the Fall of 2016 and
    the university I attended before transferring was Stony Brook University. I have no prior experience in computer science
    but I fell in love with it as soon as I took my first intro course during my freshman year. I
  and am especially interested in computer algorithims.</p>
